I'm talking about a bullshit fine you gave me about 12 years ago that I still haven't forgotten.



In my second year as a student, I was in Campbell Hall. Due to the noise, before when I had the room closest to the main room of the building, I moved upstairs, into a back corner room, to get away from the noise so I could sleep. Moving everything up the stairs by myself in one day I should add.



It seemed fine until the end of the year. I cleaned the room for hours, and the RA said it looked fine, and I thought that was the end of that. Then I was told I was being fined for a dirty refrigerat or. The fine was an amount so absurd that I thought you were making me buy the refrigerat or, but that wasn't the case. But that couldn't be right to begin with, because the RA told me my room was clean. I had a witness who saw that I had a clean refrigerat or.



You know what I found out then? Someone moved into my room downstairs , and they left the refrigerat or dirty, but you fined ME instead even though I had moved out months earlier. I sent an email about this, and received a very rude one in response. I don't remember the name, but they didn't listen to a word I said, and made me pay someone else's fine anyway under threat of putting a hold on me so I couldn't get into classes.



So, now I want my money back. I'm sure you keep records of these things, find out how much you stole from me, and either give it back, or give me one of those mini-refri gerators, it's the least you could do for putting me through all that back when I had no money and didn't need to deal with fines that you were supposed to apply to someone else.

I'll remove this 1 star review when I get my refund.Not for tuition, I knew that was high when I applied. Or at least I should have.

MELBOURNE, FLA. — Richard Turner, professor emeritus of biological sciences at Florida Institute of Technology, a respected scholar of Florida invertebrates and a guiding force at the Florida Academy of Sciences, has been awarded the academy’s highest honor, the FAS Medal.

Joining George Maul (2016), Terry Oswalt (2010) and John Trefry (2002), Turner is the fourth Florida Tech faculty member to receive one of Florida’s highest academic honors since the academy started awarding the medal in 1963.

“It has been an honor to serve science and scientists in Florida through my participation and leadership in the Academy over these 45 years,” Turner said.

The academy awards one medal annually to a Florida resident who has “contributed in an outstanding manner to the promotion of scientific research, to the stimulation of interest in the sciences, or to the diffusion of scientific knowledge.” Candidates may be research scientists, philanthropists and educators, journalists, science fair coordinators or members of industry, government or other organizations.

“As an FAS council member since 2001, I have worked closely with Dr. Turner in a wide variety of projects and administrative tasks. I have always been impressed with his respectful and thoughtful approach to problem-solving in management,” said Jeremy Montague of Barry University, past president of the academy and chair of its Honors Committee. “Whether in dealing with budgets, facilities or personnel, he always comes up with reasonable solutions without ruffling the feathers of others.”

Noting Turner’s third-degree black belt in American Kenpo karate, Montague added, “I think his intensive training in martial arts has conditioned him well to perform calmly and quietly under pressure.”

Turner, the academy’s 56th medalist, was recognized at a banquet March 9 during the group’s annual meeting at Barry University in Miami Shores.

A native of Brockton, Mass., Turner earned bachelor and master’s degrees in zoology from the University of Maine and came to Tampa soon thereafter, where he earned his doctorate in biology at the University of South Florida in 1977. He headed east to work as an assistant professor of biological sciences at Florida Tech starting in 1976, a partnership that would help shape the institution and the academic community over the next 40 years. He later chaired the Marine Biology program at Florida Tech, served as associate department head for undergraduate programs in biological sciences and then director, and was named full professor in 2016. In May 2017, Turner was named professor emeritus.

Beyond the thousands of students he has helped, Turner’s own research into a variety of Florida invertebrates – mainly the marine animals such as sea stars, sea urchins and sand dollars known as echinoderms – has illuminated the phylum Echinodermata by, among other achievements, describing a new species of sea star and sea cucumber, and two new species of brittle star from Florida. He is also an authority on the Florida apple snail.

His impact in the Biology Department at Florida Tech may only be exceeded by his impact in the Florida Academy of Sciences.

His first interaction with FAS was in 1974, when he was co-author of a paper presented at its annual meeting. Over the ensuing four-plus decades, Turner has presented or co-authored an additional 44 oral and poster papers at FAS meetings.

His involvement went well beyond presentations, however.

He became chair-elect of the academy’s Biological Sciences Section in 1977, and he later was charged with organizing annual meeting programs as program chair.

He served as associate editor and interim editor (twice) of the academy’s magazine, Florida Scientist, even as he chaired the editor search committee; as chair of the Awards Committee; and, across two terms, as president of the academy during its 50th anniversary year, 1985-86, and its 75th anniversary year, 2010-11.

Hamid Rassoul, at the time dean of the College of Science, and Michael Grace, who was then associate dean, wrote in their nomination of Turner, “Some of his most important and long-lasting work was accomplished during his two terms as president.”

Those include his promotion of the establishment of the Florida Endowment for the Sciences, for which Turner instituted a spending policy and oversaw the first annual distributions to support the purposes and values of the academy.

In both of his presidential terms, Turner and the Florida Academy of Sciences Council pursued action against state-level attempts to introduce teaching of religious-based “science” in elementary and secondary schools, with the academy issuing strong statements to the governors and state legislatures in support of scientifically based material on evolution.

In his second term, from 2009 to 2011, Turner established a budgetary process for accountability of academy finances, a critical process that had not been addressed since the early 1990s. And he strengthened procedures for the Awards Committee, ultimately producing a 50-page manual to guide the awards chair.

“Turner hopes to serve a third term as president in 2036 (the Academy’s 100th anniversary) if his health remains good in old age!” his nominators wrote.

Turner is a life member of numerous organizations, including the American Microscopical Society, the Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi, the Scientific Research Society of Sigma Xi and the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, and a charter member of the Marine Resources Council of East Florida.

Founded as "Brevard Engineering College" in 1958, Florida Institute of Technology today is a comprehensive, research-intensive national university offering undergraduate, master’s and doctoral degrees that prepare students for careers of the future. As Florida’s STEM University™ and headquarters of the Florida Academy of Sciences, Florida Tech’s approach to academics is research-driven, high-tech and hands-on, allowing our students to both gain knowledge and get real experience in applying it. Here, you don’t just learn—you do.
It All Started With 37 Cents

Florida Institute of Technology was founded in 1958 as "Brevard Engineering College." It all started as an idea in the mind of Jerome P. Keuper, Ph.D., a visionary physicist working at Cape Canaveral (now NASA Kennedy Space Center).

As university lore would have it, Dr. Keuper expressed his desire to create a scientific and technological university to a friend over drinks at a local pub. In jest, the friend pushed 37 cents in change across the table and said, “There’s your first donation, Jerry. Now go and build that college.”

So Dr. Keuper did. And what started with 37 cents as a night school for the early “missile men” of the U.S. space program is now a comprehensive national research university recognized worldwide for excellence in preparing students for careers of the future.

Working with Communications

Who Can Help Me?

The official spokesperson of Florida Tech is Wes Sumner, vice president of Marketing and Communications. He deals with matters that are potentially controversial or sensitive. He should be provided with advance notice of significant situations so that he may represent the university effectively and accurately, while minimizing any potential negative reac­tion. He also communicates university positions on issues of campus-wide impact. Contact him at 674-6218 or wsumner@fit.edu.

Adam Lowenstein, news bureau chief, is responsible for fielding media calls and responding to media requests for subject matter experts. It is usually he who connects the appropriate faculty or staff member with a reporter. Contact him at 674-8964 or adam@fit.edu.

In the Department of Athletics, Ryan Jones, athletics communication director, is responsible for publicizing sports programs. He is at jonesr@fit.edu, 674-8250.

When should I get in touch with the Vice President of Marketing and Communications or the News Bureau Chief?

Florida Tech administrators, faculty and staff are asked to call 674-8548 or one of the numbers above, when:

You are contacted by a news reporter about campus policy or a campus-wide issue

You can offer an expert opinion on current affairs

You or another from the campus community have won a major award

You have completed a research project and want to announce the results

You are responsible for an innovation that would be helpful and interesting to know about

How do we manage event coverage?

Campus departments and organizations should publicize their events only when they are open to the public, or at least to the news media. News releases are intended to spur media coverage or public attendance.

What is our policy concerning access?

Florida Tech welcomes reporters and photographers on campus as it welcomes the public. However, visiting media are asked to notify Marketing and Communications in advance so that the visit can be appropriately facilitated.

It is Florida Tech policy to be as helpful as possible to the media. Students, staff and faculty have a right to privacy; neither reporters nor the public are allowed to disrupt classroom instruction or other educational functions. Speaking to members of the news media on the part of faculty, staff or students is always voluntary.

If a reporter approaches you in person with an impromptu question, feel free to refer him/her to the Communications office at 674-8548. Never feel obligated to answer questions on-the-fly when you haven’t had time to prepare. Reporters are always asked to coordinate any inquiry regarding campus life or personnel through Marketing & Communications.

News media must obtain prior permission from Marketing and Communications to enter classrooms, medical facilities and teaching laboratories. Permission usually will be granted, as long as access does not disrupt university functions or jeopardize safety. Residence halls are closed to the news media un­less reporters make prior arrangements and receive permission. Any requests you receive to videotape specific campus activities or functions should be referred to the Communications office. All requests for commercial, non-news photography, filmmaking or videotaping should also be referred to the Communications office.

The news media should not be allowed to infringe on the privacy of students, parents, administrators, faculty or staff. There are occasions when information will not be made public for valid legal, regulatory or privacy reasons. For example, no statements will be made to the media concerning a legal matter, or a potentially actionable legal matter, until it has been cleared.

Jarrett Walker has worked on public transit policy and design in North America, Europe, Russia, Australia and New Zealand.

Event is Free and Open to the Public

MELBOURNE, FLA. — An international consultant in public transit network design and policy will speak about his work around the world and offer insights intro Brevard County transit at the spring F. Alan Smith Distinguished Lecture Tuesday, April 3, at Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne.

Jarrett Walker, whose Portland, Oregon-based firm Jarrett Walker + Associates has worked on public transit policy and design in 100 cities from Anchorage to Auckland, will speak and answer questions from 6-7:30 p.m. in the Hartley Room at the Denius Student Center.

His presentation is “Abundant Access: Planning Urban Transportation for a Free Society.” Here’s how it is described: “Cars seem to give us freedom, but only until we get stuck in traffic. What’s more, our car-centered transportation system is the opposite of freedom for people who can’t or shouldn’t drive. It can literally trap them in their homes, or endanger their lives if they try to walk or cycle. What would it mean to plan transportation with freedom as the primary goal? How do new technologies change our options? And how might our world be better as a result?”

The event is free and open to the public, but pre-registration is required by clicking here. It is being co-sponsored by the Melbourne Regional Chamber of East Central Florida and Rotary Club Indialantic.

Born in 1962, Walker grew up in Portland during a time when the city first made its decisive commitment to be focused on people rather than cars. He went on to earn his BA at Pomona College and a Ph.D. in theater arts and humanities at Stanford University.

A full-time consultant since 1991, Walker has led numerous major planning projects in cities and towns of all sizes across North America, Europe, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. He is the author of the 2011 book, Human Transit: How Clearer Thinking About Public Transit Can Enrich Our Communities and Our Lives and runs the popular blog http://humantransit.org/.

The lecture series’ founder and benefactor, F. Alan Smith, has had a prestigious career in a transportation-related industry himself. He spent more than three decades in leadership positions at General Motors in the U.S. and Canada, including serving as executive vice president of finance of General Motors and president and general manager of General Motors of Canada, Ltd.

Smith, who now lives in Indialantic, has served on Florida Tech’s Board of Trustees since 1996.

The lecture series, which began in 2007 as the F. Alan Smith Visiting Executive Program, was created to attract corporate executives to speak to students, faculty and community leaders at Florida Tech. At least one executive speaker is welcomed to campus in both the fall and spring semesters.

Find out more about the series at www.fit.edu/distinguished-lecture-series. For questions about the Walker lecture, contact Florida Tech’s Office of Development at 321-674-8962.

MELBOURNE, FLA. — An international consultant in public transit network design and policy will speak about his work around the world and offer insights intro Brevard County transit at the spring F. Alan Smith Distinguished Lecture Tuesday, April 3, at Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne.

Jarrett Walker, whose Portland, Oregon-based firm Jarrett Walker + Associates has worked on public transit policy and design in 100 cities from Anchorage to Auckland, will speak and answer questions from 6-7:30 p.m. in the Hartley Room at the Denius Student Center.

His presentation is “Abundant Access: Planning Urban Transportation for a Free Society.” Here’s how it is described: “Cars seem to give us freedom, but only until we get stuck in traffic. What’s more, our car-centered transportation system is the opposite of freedom for people who can’t or shouldn’t drive. It can literally trap them in their homes, or endanger their lives if they try to walk or cycle. What would it mean to plan transportation with freedom as the primary goal? How do new technologies change our options? And how might our world be better as a result?”

The event is free and open to the public, but pre-registration is required by clicking here. It is being co-sponsored by the Melbourne Regional Chamber of East Central Florida and Rotary Club Indialantic.

Born in 1962, Walker grew up in Portland during a time when the city first made its decisive commitment to be focused on people rather than cars. He went on to earn his BA at Pomona College and a Ph.D. in theater arts and humanities at Stanford University.

A full-time consultant since 1991, Walker has led numerous major planning projects in cities and towns of all sizes across North America, Europe, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. He is the author of the 2011 book, Human Transit: How Clearer Thinking About Public Transit Can Enrich Our Communities and Our Lives and runs the popular blog http://humantransit.org/.

The lecture series’ founder and benefactor, F. Alan Smith, has had a prestigious career in a transportation-related industry himself. He spent more than three decades in leadership positions at General Motors in the U.S. and Canada, including serving as executive vice president of finance of General Motors and president and general manager of General Motors of Canada, Ltd.

Smith, who now lives in Indialantic, has served on Florida Tech’s Board of Trustees since 1996.

The lecture series, which began in 2007 as the F. Alan Smith Visiting Executive Program, was created to attract corporate executives to speak to students, faculty and community leaders at Florida Tech. At least one executive speaker is welcomed to campus in both the fall and spring semesters.

Jill Tarter is an astronomer who has spent her career seeking to answer the question of whether we are alone in the universe. Her work is the basis for Jodie Foster’s character in the 1997 movie "Contact."

Tickets Available for March 22-24 Event in Orlando

MELBOURNE, FLA. — Jill Tarter, the astronomer who has spent her career seeking to answer the question of whether we are alone in the universe, and whose work was the basis for Jodie Foster’s character in the 1997 movie Contact, will be the closing speaker at the 2018 Cross Cultural Management Summit March 22-24 at Caribe Royale in Orlando.

Tarter was one of 10 initial employees at the SETI Institute, the Mountain View, California-based operation that opened in 1985 to search for extraterrestrial intelligence. And she since spent the majority of her professional career attempting to answer the age-old question, “Are we alone?”

She will speak at the Summit starting at 11:45 a.m. Saturday, March 24, offering, “A Cosmic Perspective: Searching for Aliens, Finding Ourselves.”

“We haven’t yet found life beyond Earth, but there is a vast amount of potentially-habitable real estate to explore,” she says. “The 21st century will be the century in which we will find some answers to this old question; there are many paths we will investigate.”

The Summit, with the theme “Going Beyond Global,” will feature presentations by thought leaders, interactive discussions, and one-on-one networking opportunities that combine to create a productive and fun learning environment.

The first day will also include an appearance by famed moonwalker Buzz Aldrin. He will be presented with the Institute for Cross Cultural Management’s Trailblazer award. Given to professionals who have changed the paradigm of cross cultural management, the award recognizes Aldrin’s ground-breaking inclusion of cultural competence as one of the mission-critical areas of Mars colonization.

The Summit will then unfold along three topic tracks:

Culture And Innovation: The Balance Between Technology and Humanity

Culture And Problem Solving: The Balance Between Risk and Reward

Culture And Well-Being: The Balance Between Work and Life

For her work, Tarter currently holds the Bernard M. Oliver Chair for SETI Research at the SETI Institute. She received her Bachelor of Engineering Physics Degree with Distinction from Cornell University and her Master’s Degree and a Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of California, Berkeley.

She has served as project scientist for NASA’s SETI program, the High Resolution Microwave Survey, and has conducted numerous observational programs at radio observatories worldwide.

Many people were exposed to her work from Contact, where Jodie Foster plays a scientist based on Tarter. Tarter spent weeks speaking to Foster before and during filming.

The Atlantic Sixgill Remains a

Mysterious, Deep-Sea Dweller

MELBOURNE, FLA. — A team of scientists led by Florida Institute of Technology’s Toby Daly-Engel has confirmed after decades of uncertainty that sixgill sharks residing in the Atlantic Ocean are a different species than their counterparts in the Indian and Pacific oceans.

The new species has a new name: the Atlantic sixgill shark.

With ancestors dating back over 250 million years, well before dinosaurs, sixgill sharks are among the oldest creatures on Earth. Yet the fact that they reside at extreme ocean depths, sometimes thousands of feet below the surface, has made them especially challenging to study.

Using 1,310 base pairs of two mitochondrial genes, Daly-Engel, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Florida Tech, and colleagues from MarAlliance in Belize, Florida State University Coastal and Marine Laboratory in Teresa, Florida, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center in Panama City, determined there are enough genetic differences between what had long been considered a single species, Hexanchus nakamurai, to rename the Atlantic variety Hexanchus vitulus.

“We showed that the sixgills in the Atlantic are actually very different from the ones in the Indian and Pacific Oceans on a molecular level, to the point where it is obvious that they’re a different species even though they look very similar to the naked eye,” Daly-Engel said.

Their findings were reported this week in the online edition of the journal Marine Biodiversity. Click here for the PDF.

Measuring up to 6 feet in length, Atlantic sixgill sharks are far smaller than their Indo-Pacific relatives, which can grow to 15 feet or longer. They have unique, saw-like lower teeth and six gill slits, as their name suggests. Most sharks have five gill slits.

With their new classification, Atlantic sixgill sharks will now have a better chance at long-term survival, Daly-Engel noted.

“Because we now know there are two unique species, we have a sense of the overall variation in populations of sixgills. We understand that if we overfish one of them, they will not replenish from elsewhere in the world,” she said.

And that’s the other benefit of this research: a better understanding of shark diversity.

“Particularly diversity in the deep ocean,” Daly-Engel said, “which we don’t know much about.”

The Northrop Grumman Engineering & Science Student Design Showcase, seen here in 2017, is set for Friday, April 6, on the Florida Tech campus. The event runs from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and is open to the public.

Free Public Event Features

Over 100 STEM Projects

MELBOURNE, FLA. — Students in Florida Institute of Technology’s colleges of engineering and science will display their academic achievement and technical prowess at the Northrop Grumman Engineering & Science Student Design Showcase from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday, April 6, at the Clemente Center on campus.

Featuring engineering and science projects that creatively demonstrate Florida Tech’s renowned hands-on approach to education, the annual event is free and open to the public. The Clemente Center is located on University Boulevard just west of Babcock Street.

“It is one thing to be able to design a product, but it is another thing entirely to manufacture, build, test and present that product from start to finish, especially in a group setting,” said Ashton Tassinari, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering who was team leader in 2017 for the Formula Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE) car project.

In 2009, a $1 million endowment gift from Northrop Grumman Corporation provided ongoing support for the students’ work. Sponsorships from other local and national companies also assist. These gifts reflect a commitment to boosting interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs and the value of learning beyond the classroom.

Showcase organizers note that project-based learning through student design gives students experience that not only helps them gain a better understanding of their field but also helps them acquire highly sought-after workplace skills like collaboration, communication and problem solving.

The showcase includes projects developed by undergraduate students working side by side in Florida Tech’s research and design facilities and applying classroom principles to real-world problems. Participating students, who must conceive, research and/or design and implement their projects, gain experience in applying science or engineering knowledge and the fundamental principles of their respective majors.

“For me, working with a student design team has been more than another group project,” Tassinari, the mechanical engineering senior, said. “It has made me a better engineer because I am a stronger teammate and leader, it has improved my communication skills immensely, taught me hands-on manufacturing skills, and improved my ability to understand theory in a practical way.”

Some of this year’s projects include Mars rovers systems, an artificially intelligent indoor farm, a robotic prosthetic hand, a police drone and a high-speed jet unmanned aerial vehicle.

At the conclusion of the showcase, Northrop Grumman officials will present “Best in Show” prizes for one project each from the engineering and science colleges. Florida Tech President Dwayne McCay will present President’s Cup awards to top projects from each college as well as a special award for design and innovation.

Florida Academy of Sciences Honors Committee chairman Jeremy Montague of Barry University, left, congratulates Florida Tech professor emeritus Richard Turner on being named the 2018 Florida Academy of Sciences Medalist.

Fourth Florida Tech Faculty Member

to be Honored Since 1963

MELBOURNE, FLA. — Richard Turner, professor emeritus of biological sciences at Florida Institute of Technology, a respected scholar of Florida invertebrates and a guiding force at the Florida Academy of Sciences, has been awarded the academy’s highest honor, the FAS Medal.

Joining George Maul (2016), Terry Oswalt (2010) and John Trefry (2002), Turner is the fourth Florida Tech faculty member to receive one of Florida’s highest academic honors since the academy started awarding the medal in 1963.

“It has been an honor to serve science and scientists in Florida through my participation and leadership in the Academy over these 45 years,” Turner said.

The academy awards one medal annually to a Florida resident who has “contributed in an outstanding manner to the promotion of scientific research, to the stimulation of interest in the sciences, or to the diffusion of scientific knowledge.” Candidates may be research scientists, philanthropists and educators, journalists, science fair coordinators or members of industry, government or other organizations.

“As an FAS council member since 2001, I have worked closely with Dr. Turner in a wide variety of projects and administrative tasks. I have always been impressed with his respectful and thoughtful approach to problem-solving in management,” said Jeremy Montague of Barry University, past president of the academy and chair of its Honors Committee. “Whether in dealing with budgets, facilities or personnel, he always comes up with reasonable solutions without ruffling the feathers of others.”

Noting Turner’s third-degree black belt in American Kenpo karate, Montague added, “I think his intensive training in martial arts has conditioned him well to perform calmly and quietly under pressure.”

Turner, the academy’s 56th medalist, was recognized at a banquet March 9 during the group’s annual meeting at Barry University in Miami Shores.

A native of Brockton, Mass., Turner earned bachelor and master’s degrees in zoology from the University of Maine and came to Tampa soon thereafter, where he earned his doctorate in biology at the University of South Florida in 1977. He headed east to work as an assistant professor of biological sciences at Florida Tech starting in 1976, a partnership that would help shape the institution and the academic community over the next 40 years. He later chaired the Marine Biology program at Florida Tech, served as associate department head for undergraduate programs in biological sciences and then director, and was named full professor in 2016. In May 2017, Turner was named professor emeritus.

Beyond the thousands of students he has helped, Turner’s own research into a variety of Florida invertebrates – mainly the marine animals such as sea stars, sea urchins and sand dollars known as echinoderms – has illuminated the phylum Echinodermata by, among other achievements, describing a new species of sea star and sea cucumber, and two new species of brittle star from Florida. He is also an authority on the Florida apple snail.

His impact in the Biology Department at Florida Tech may only be exceeded by his impact in the Florida Academy of Sciences.

His first interaction with FAS was in 1974, when he was co-author of a paper presented at its annual meeting. Over the ensuing four-plus decades, Turner has presented or co-authored an additional 44 oral and poster papers at FAS meetings.

His involvement went well beyond presentations, however.

He became chair-elect of the academy’s Biological Sciences Section in 1977, and he later was charged with organizing annual meeting programs as program chair.

He served as associate editor and interim editor (twice) of the academy’s magazine, Florida Scientist, even as he chaired the editor search committee; as chair of the Awards Committee; and, across two terms, as president of the academy during its 50th anniversary year, 1985-86, and its 75th anniversary year, 2010-11.

Hamid Rassoul, at the time dean of the College of Science, and Michael Grace, who was then associate dean, wrote in their nomination of Turner, “Some of his most important and long-lasting work was accomplished during his two terms as president.”

Those include his promotion of the establishment of the Florida Endowment for the Sciences, for which Turner instituted a spending policy and oversaw the first annual distributions to support the purposes and values of the academy.

In both of his presidential terms, Turner and the Florida Academy of Sciences Council pursued action against state-level attempts to introduce teaching of religious-based “science” in elementary and secondary schools, with the academy issuing strong statements to the governors and state legislatures in support of scientifically based material on evolution.

In his second term, from 2009 to 2011, Turner established a budgetary process for accountability of academy finances, a critical process that had not been addressed since the early 1990s. And he strengthened procedures for the Awards Committee, ultimately producing a 50-page manual to guide the awards chair.

“Turner hopes to serve a third term as president in 2036 (the Academy’s 100th anniversary) if his health remains good in old age!” his nominators wrote.

Turner is a life member of numerous organizations, including the American Microscopical Society, the Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi, the Scientific Research Society of Sigma Xi and the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, and a charter member of the Marine Resources Council of East Florida.

Florida Tech awarded Marilyn Link an honorary doctorate at Fall Commencement last December. Ms. Link passed away on Monday, March 19.

A Guiding Voice for Florida Tech, Link Foundation

MELBOURNE, FLA. — Marilyn Link, a passionate advocate for the power of education and the sanctity of the natural world who served for more than three decades on the Florida Institute of Technology Board of Trustees, passed away Monday. She was 94.

Funeral arrangements have not been announced.

A Glendale, Calif., native, Ms. Link headed to the classroom to earn bachelor and master’s degrees in education, and then, starting in 1945, to the cockpit to earn her commercial pilot’s license. She held ratings for both single and multi-engine planes and instrument flight.

So assisted in the education division of her family’s Link Aviation Inc., and later worked for both Mohawk Airlines and Hughes Airwest. She served as a member of the Women’s Advisory Committee for the Federal Aviation Administration and also worked for the National Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian Institution. She was a contributing editor at Flying magazine.

In early 1970s, after serving as a public school teacher in New Jersey and later an instructor at the University of Nebraska, Ms. Link came to the Atlantic coast of Florida at the request of her brother, Edwin Link, to serve as the first manager of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute. Edwin Link helped Harbor Branch founder Seward Johnson Sr. develop the institute.

Ms. Link went on to serve as a member of the HBOI Board of Trustees and was currently serving as director emerita on the board of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation.

Her brother, who invented the Link Flight Trainer and is considered the father of flight simulation, helped establish the Link family connection at Florida Tech. In 1979, the university’s trustees voted to name a building in his honor.

And a few years later, in 1984, Marilyn Link joined Florida Tech’s Board of Trustees, where she offered her steady guidance and powerful perspective for nearly 35 years. She was trustee emerita at the time of her passing.

“Marilyn never sought the spotlight, but her guidance at Florida Tech was no less important and impactful for her quiet approach,” said Florida Tech President Dwayne McCay. “Her deep knowledge of aviation and real-world experience in that industry, and her belief in the importance of the marine world, meant that two key areas of study here at Florida Tech benefited greatly from her vision, as well.”

The Link Foundation, for which Marilyn Link serves as a special advisor, has awarded nearly $15 million in grants to Florida Tech and many other non-profit organization interested in the mastery of the air and sea, and the development of energy resources and their conservation, and in simulation and training.

“FIT has a great tradition of leadership in aeronautics and ocean engineering and marine sciences and has been a great partner in our efforts,” she has said.

Ms. Link’s generosity has also helped make possible the digitalization of the Edwin A. Link Special Collection at the university library. And she has established a charitable gift annuity at Florida Tech, calling it a wise decision to “help make a lasting contribution to the university I love.”

For these contributions and many others, the university awarded Ms. Link an honorary doctorate at Fall Commencement on Dec. 16, 2017.

Henri Cartier-Bresson's silver gelatin print from 1932, "Hyères," is among the photographs in the new exhibition at Florida Tech's Foosaner Art Museum.

‘French Twist’, Opening March 24,

Offers Images from Pioneering Artists

MELBOURNE, FLA. — The variety and inventiveness of native and immigrant photographers working in France in the early 20th century will be front and center as the new Foosaner Art Museum exhibition French Twist: Masterworks of Photography from Atget to Man Ray opens March 24.

The show, which will run through May 19, features over 60 photographs.

Between the two world wars, Paris saw a fervor of change. The city became an epicenter of artistic exploration, attracting international avant-garde artists, including photographers.

“This is an exciting exhibit of beautiful photographs, and it reveals the great diversity among the Parisian avant-garde artists of the early 20th century,” said Executive Director and Chief Curator of University Museums Carla Funk. “From street photography to Surrealism, ‘French Twist’ has it all.”

With works dating from 1900 to 1945, artists in the exhibit include Eugéne Atget (1857–1927), Ilse Bing (1899–1998), Brassai (1899–1984), Henri Cartier-Bresson (1908–2004) and Man Ray (1890–1976).

French Twist is drawn from the private collection of Michael Mattis and Judith Hochberg and was organized by art2art Circulating Exhibitions.

The Foosaner Art Museum, 1463 Highland Ave. in the Eau Gallie Arts District of Melbourne, features changing exhibitions of nationally and internationally recognized art. The museum also draws from its permanent collection of over 5,000 objects to present exhibitions relevant to the community and revealing of art historical movements. Hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday. Free admission. Find out more at www.foosanerartmuseum.org or by calling 321-674-8916.

This lined bristletooth fish is swimming in a marine protected area in the Philippines, where new Florida Tech research has found fish grow healthier than in areas where fishing is allowed.

Findings Reveal Positive Impact

of Controversial Tool

MELBOURNE, FLA. — New research from Florida Institute of Technology finds that fish born in marine reserves where fishing is prohibited grow to be larger, healthier and more successful at reproduction.

The findings, recently published in the online journal Plos One, highlight the positive impact of a tool of fisheries management that has long been a source of frustration and concern for fishermen, who believe such restrictions impinge on their livelihood.

In their examination of marine reserves, also known as marine protected areas or MPAs, around coral reefs in the Philippines, Robert Fidler, a Fulbright scholar who recently received his Ph.D. from Florida Institute of Technology, and his major professor, Fulbright faculty scholar Ralph Turingan, found evidence that MPAs in fact helped to produce and maintain the more desirable large-bodied and older fish within populations that have been fished by local fishermen for centuries.

“The first reaction to marine reserves by local users is traditionally, ‘You close all of these fishing areas and we can’t fish anymore in there,’” Turingan said. “That is the wrong way to think. These MPAs are actually important is sustaining fishing activities.”

And, Turingan added, “Our evidence shows this is a long-term thing.”

Fidler, Turingan and their collaborators found that key life-history traits in three coral-reef fishes – maximum length, growth rate, and body size and age at sexual maturity – are significantly improved in the brown surgeonfish, lined bristletooth and manybar goatfish living within MPAs compared with the same species outside of MPAs.

Because fishing removes the largest fish, heavy fishing on coral reefs drives the fish to mature at younger ages and smaller sizes.

Small fish have fewer, smaller eggs that, if they survive to hatching, produce weaker fish. By contrast, larger fish produce higher quality eggs, and more of them, which in turn produce healthier fish that grow larger and reproduce more, and the cycle continues.

The researchers found that the more robust fish naturally migrate from the MPAs to the fished areas, where they can be harvested by fishermen.

“It’s like raising them in aquaculture and putting them back, but this is more natural way of replenishing depleted stocks,” Turingan said.

Though their findings were based on studies of coral reef fish in the Philippines, Fidler and Turingan predicted the results could be replicated wherever marine reserves are established on coral reefs.

Evening of Hope X Raises $134K

for Research, Scholarships

MELBOURNE, FLA. — The Scott Center for Autism Treatment at Florida Institute of Technology unveiled its new telehealth services and honored founders Ed and Cheryl Scott while raising $134,000 for research and treatment, scholarships and critical subsidies at its signature annual fundraiser, An Evening of Hope X.

At the Feb. 17 event held at the Merritt Island home of Florida Tech Trustee Mike Shah and his wife, Rashmi, guests used virtual reality to explore the Scott Center’s new Telehealth Services program and the Scott Center itself. The new Telehealth Services program provides screening, diagnosis, treatment and training for families with and caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorder who live in areas where services are otherwise inaccessible. It also furthers the Center’s mission—and that of founders Ed and Cheryl Scott—to make treatment available to a far greater number of people.

The Scotts shared the story of their son, Reece, who was diagnosed with autism in the 1990s. There was little information and few services at that time for children with autism spectrum disorder. Reece overcame many challenges with the support of his parents, teachers and therapists, eventually graduating from Georgetown University and pursuing a master’s degree in modern Japanese studies at the University of Oxford in England. As a result of their experience with their son, Ed and Cheryl Scott funded the creation of the Scott Center in 2009.

“Ed and Cheryl Scott are key to the foundation of the Scott Center and its ongoing mission to provide clinical service, research and training in our community,” said Executive Director Michael E. Kelley. “We are so grateful for their continued support —and the support of the community—which allows us to not just maintain but strengthen our ability to serve individuals and families affected by autism.”

All funds raised at An Evening of Hope X will go toward research, treatment, subsidies and the Scott Center’s WISH scholarships, which provide early intervention treatment for children with autism and related disorders to families that otherwise could not afford it.

Guests at An Evening of Hope X enjoyed food by Taste of India and Green Turtle Market and danced to music by Wonderama.

For An Evening of Hope X, Kempf’s Jewelers in Indialantic once again donated a Rolex Oyster Perpetual GMT-MASTER II, which was raffled off as a key component of the Scott Center fundraising efforts. The 40mm, stainless steel timepiece, valued at $8,450, was won by Dee Dee Sheffield at the raffle drawing on Feb. 24.

The Northrop Grumman Engineering & Science Student Design Showcase, seen here in 2017, is set for Friday, April 6, on the Florida Tech campus. The event runs from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and is open to the public.

Free Public Event Features

Over 100 STEM Projects

MELBOURNE, FLA. — Students in Florida Institute of Technology’s colleges of engineering and science will display their academic achievement and technical prowess at the Northrop Grumman Engineering & Science Student Design Showcase from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday, April 6, at the Clemente Center on campus.

Featuring engineering and science projects that creatively demonstrate Florida Tech’s renowned hands-on approach to education, the annual event is free and open to the public. The Clemente Center is located on University Boulevard just west of Babcock Street.

“It is one thing to be able to design a product, but it is another thing entirely to manufacture, build, test and present that product from start to finish, especially in a group setting,” said Ashton Tassinari, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering who was team leader in 2017 for the Formula Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE) car project.

In 2009, a $1 million endowment gift from Northrop Grumman Corporation provided ongoing support for the students’ work. Sponsorships from other local and national companies also assist. These gifts reflect a commitment to boosting interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs and the value of learning beyond the classroom.

Showcase organizers note that project-based learning through student design gives students experience that not only helps them gain a better understanding of their field but also helps them acquire highly sought-after workplace skills like collaboration, communication and problem solving.

The showcase includes projects developed by undergraduate students working side by side in Florida Tech’s research and design facilities and applying classroom principles to real-world problems. Participating students, who must conceive, research and/or design and implement their projects, gain experience in applying science or engineering knowledge and the fundamental principles of their respective majors.

“For me, working with a student design team has been more than another group project,” Tassinari, the mechanical engineering senior, said. “It has made me a better engineer because I am a stronger teammate and leader, it has improved my communication skills immensely, taught me hands-on manufacturing skills, and improved my ability to understand theory in a practical way.”

Some of this year’s projects include Mars rovers systems, an artificially intelligent indoor farm, a robotic prosthetic hand, a police drone and a high-speed jet unmanned aerial vehicle.

At the conclusion of the showcase, Northrop Grumman officials will present “Best in Show” prizes for one project each from the engineering and science colleges. Florida Tech President Dwayne McCay will present President’s Cup awards to top projects from each college as well as a special award for design and innovation.

Florida Tech awarded Marilyn Link an honorary doctorate at Fall Commencement last December. Ms. Link passed away on Monday, March 19.

A Guiding Voice for Florida Tech, Link Foundation

MELBOURNE, FLA. — Marilyn Link, a passionate advocate for the power of education and the sanctity of the natural world who served for more than three decades on the Florida Institute of Technology Board of Trustees, passed away Monday. She was 94.

Funeral arrangements have not been announced.

A Glendale, Calif., native, Ms. Link headed to the classroom to earn bachelor and master’s degrees in education, and then, starting in 1945, to the cockpit to earn her commercial pilot’s license. She held ratings for both single and multi-engine planes and instrument flight.

So assisted in the education division of her family’s Link Aviation Inc., and later worked for both Mohawk Airlines and Hughes Airwest. She served as a member of the Women’s Advisory Committee for the Federal Aviation Administration and also worked for the National Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian Institution. She was a contributing editor at Flying magazine.

In early 1970s, after serving as a public school teacher in New Jersey and later an instructor at the University of Nebraska, Ms. Link came to the Atlantic coast of Florida at the request of her brother, Edwin Link, to serve as the first manager of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute. Edwin Link helped Harbor Branch founder Seward Johnson Sr. develop the institute.

Ms. Link went on to serve as a member of the HBOI Board of Trustees and was currently serving as director emerita on the board of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation.

Her brother, who invented the Link Flight Trainer and is considered the father of flight simulation, helped establish the Link family connection at Florida Tech. In 1979, the university’s trustees voted to name a building in his honor.

And a few years later, in 1984, Marilyn Link joined Florida Tech’s Board of Trustees, where she offered her steady guidance and powerful perspective for nearly 35 years. She was trustee emerita at the time of her passing.

“Marilyn never sought the spotlight, but her guidance at Florida Tech was no less important and impactful for her quiet approach,” said Florida Tech President Dwayne McCay. “Her deep knowledge of aviation and real-world experience in that industry, and her belief in the importance of the marine world, meant that two key areas of study here at Florida Tech benefited greatly from her vision, as well.”

The Link Foundation, for which Marilyn Link serves as a special advisor, has awarded nearly $15 million in grants to Florida Tech and many other non-profit organization interested in the mastery of the air and sea, and the development of energy resources and their conservation, and in simulation and training.

“FIT has a great tradition of leadership in aeronautics and ocean engineering and marine sciences and has been a great partner in our efforts,” she has said.

Ms. Link’s generosity has also helped make possible the digitalization of the Edwin A. Link Special Collection at the university library. And she has established a charitable gift annuity at Florida Tech, calling it a wise decision to “help make a lasting contribution to the university I love.”

For these contributions and many others, the university awarded Ms. Link an honorary doctorate at Fall Commencement on Dec. 16, 2017.

MELBOURNE, FLA. — New research from Florida Institute of Technology finds that fish born in marine reserves where fishing is prohibited grow to be larger, healthier and more successful at reproduction.

The findings, recently published in the online journal Plos One, highlight the positive impact of a tool of fisheries management that has long been a source of frustration and concern for fishermen, who believe such restrictions impinge on their livelihood.

In their examination of marine reserves, also known as marine protected areas or MPAs, around coral reefs in the Philippines, Robert Fidler, a Fulbright scholar who recently received his Ph.D. from Florida Institute of Technology, and his major professor, Fulbright faculty scholar Ralph Turingan, found evidence that MPAs in fact helped to produce and maintain the more desirable large-bodied and older fish within populations that have been fished by local fishermen for centuries.

“The first reaction to marine reserves by local users is traditionally, ‘You close all of these fishing areas and we can’t fish anymore in there,’” Turingan said. “That is the wrong way to think. These MPAs are actually important is sustaining fishing activities.”

And, Turingan added, “Our evidence shows this is a long-term thing.”

Fidler, Turingan and their collaborators found that key life-history traits in three coral-reef fishes – maximum length, growth rate, and body size and age at sexual maturity – are significantly improved in the brown surgeonfish, lined bristletooth and manybar goatfish living within MPAs compared with the same species outside of MPAs.

Because fishing removes the largest fish, heavy fishing on coral reefs drives the fish to mature at younger ages and smaller sizes.

Small fish have fewer, smaller eggs that, if they survive to hatching, produce weaker fish. By contrast, larger fish produce higher quality eggs, and more of them, which in turn produce healthier fish that grow larger and reproduce more, and the cycle continues.

The researchers found that the more robust fish naturally migrate from the MPAs to the fished areas, where they can be harvested by fishermen.

“It’s like raising them in aquaculture and putting them back, but this is more natural way of replenishing depleted stocks,” Turingan said.

Though their findings were based on studies of coral reef fish in the Philippines, Fidler and Turingan predicted the results could be replicated wherever marine reserves are established on coral reefs.

A bonefish larva 30 hours after hatching. Scientists have for the first time induced spawning in wild bonefish.

Breakthrough Could Help Restore

Population of Popular Sportfish

MELBOURNE, FLA. — A team led by Florida Institute of Technology’s Jonathan Shenker and Paul Wills of Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute at Florida Atlantic University has for the first time successfully induced spawning of wild bonefish and hatched the fertilized eggs into larvae.

The Bonefish Restoration Research Project, an initiative sponsored by Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, has been attempting since 2016 to spawn and raise bonefish in captivity. The researchers reached this milestone during field experiments in January in the Bahamas, with assistance from the Cape Eleuthera Institute.

The team successfully used injections of reproductive hormone to induce final-mature eggs in a female that had been captured from the wild in a pre-spawning state of development.

Bonefish are integral to Florida’s travel and tourism industry. It is estimated that bonefish, tarpon and other species in the ‘flats fishery’ contribute more than $465 million annually to the economy in the Florida Keys.

“Ultimately, success in this project will give us another tool in our toolbox as we work to restore the bonefish population in the Florida Keys,” said Bonefish & Tarpon Trust President Jim McDuffie.

Through BRRP, the Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, in collaboration with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, is pioneering the spawning and rearing of bonefish in captivity to provide stock to replenish the Florida Keys bonefish population as part of the broader restoration strategy. The primary goals of the five-year-long program, which began in mid-2016, are to learn how to spawn bonefish in aquaculture systems, rear the resulting larvae and juvenile fish, and ultimately, to help population restoration efforts in the Keys ecosystem.

“We now know that we can indeed get bonefish to spawn in captivity,” Shenker said. “This success will help us optimize methods to induce spawning of fish brought in from the natural habitat, and to spawn fish maintained for a long time in a controlled aquaculture facility.”

Wills added, “We are gaining a wealth of information about the biology of this species from this one successful spawn, and future spawns will only yield more.”

HORIZONS Scholarship

MAE student winner

Junior Christina Lucas was awarded the prestigious HORIZONS Foundation scholarship by Women in Defense, a National Security Organization and an affiliate of the National Defense Industrial Association. Ms. Lucas was one of three students nationally to received a scholarship. The two other students were from Carnegie Mellon University and Georgetown University.

Ms. Lucas is a junior in Mechanical Engineering. She is focused on mobile robots and unmanned autonomous vehicles. Her work as an Intern in the Robotics and Spatial Systems Lab (RASSL) at Florida Tech has resulted in the development of a six-legged robot prototype. “A basic idea of how it would be useful is that it will be able to go up and around obstacles where other robots are not able to go, therefore making it less dangerous for troops,” Lucas said. She has begun a peer-reviewed paper awaiting publication and preparation of a patent for this robot. The application is aiding troops in dangerous environments. She intends to pursue a career in the development of these types of advanced military systems.

It All Started With 37 Cents

Florida Institute of Technology was founded in 1958 as "Brevard Engineering College." It all started as an idea in the mind of Jerome P. Keuper, Ph.D., a visionary physicist working at Cape Canaveral (now NASA Kennedy Space Center).

As university lore would have it, Dr. Keuper expressed his desire to create a scientific and technological university to a friend over drinks at a local pub. In jest, the friend pushed 37 cents in change across the table and said, “There’s your first donation, Jerry. Now go and build that college.”

So Dr. Keuper did. And what started with 37 cents as a night school for the early “missile men” of the U.S. space program is now a comprehensive national research university recognized worldwide for excellence in preparing students for careers of the future.

Core Values

Research for the Benefit of All Humankind

Education for a Lifetime of Success
